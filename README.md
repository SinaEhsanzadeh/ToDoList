# ToDo List
This project aims to make a functional todo list program that allows you to make projects and assign tasks to them which you can monitor and update whenever deemed necessary.

# Features
## Projects
You can make projects which serve as containers for lists of tasks related to one project. One can edit the content of a project- such as name and description- to have a clear and consice goal laid out for them.
## Tasks
Tasks are the planned events one will use to monitor the progress on their projects. With three statuses of todo, doing, and done, you will be able to keep awareness of the progress on different tasks.
